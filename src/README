            *** THIS DIRECTORY IS FOR JEMPLATE HACKERS ONLY ***


This src directory contains various Perl and JavaScript files that get
stitched together to make the Lemplate Perl/CPAN distribution.

If you want to hack on the Lemplate parser or runtime code, you can
change the files in this directory. To build your changes into the
Lemplate distribution modules simply run:

    make

from this directory.

This directory is not included in the Lemplate CPAN distribution.
